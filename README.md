# Local Password Sniff Malware

## Overview
This is a simple password sniffing malware that I created for educational purposes. It is a simple malware that logs when you run sudo commands and logs the password you enter. It then saves the password to a hidden file called hp (hidden passwords) on user root `~/.hp`in the same directory as the malware. This malware is meant to be run on Linux and Mac OS machines.

## Context
Sudo is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser. It originally stood for "superuser do" as the older versions of sudo were designed to run commands only as the superuser. However, the later versions added support for running commands not only as the superuser but also as other (restricted) users, and thus it is also commonly expanded as "substitute user do".

### Sudo

The `sudo.c`, `makeSudo.sh`, and `removeSudo.sh` files are used to create the malware that pretends to be sudo.   
* The `sudo.c` file is the source code for the malware.
* The `makeSudo.sh` file is a shell script creates a function on bash and zsh source that compiles `sudo.c` file and moves add a alias for sudo referring to the new sudo compiled program. 
* The `removeSudo.sh` file is a shell script that removes the compiled file from the `/usr/bin` directory.

### NSudo

In the context of this malware, NSudo is the name of malware version that does not gets linked to the sudo command. The `nsudo.c`, `makeNSudo.sh`, and `removeNSudo.sh` files are used to create the malware that works like sudo and log the password when you run the `nsudo` command on the terminal.  
This could be used to inject the malware on other processes without changing the default behavior of the sudo command.
